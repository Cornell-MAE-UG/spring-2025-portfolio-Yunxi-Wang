My name is Yunxi Wang, and I am a Mechanical Engineering Student at Cornell University. I am interested in robotics and it's applications in aerospace. I am a student developer at the Cornell Mechatronics Learning Studio, where I create instructional labs for students on subjects such as motor-selection and encoders. 

Take a look at [my projects](https://github.com/YunxiWang/Yunxi-Wang-Portfolio/tree/main/_projects) and [my CV](https://github.com/YunxiWang/Yunxi-Wang-Portfolio/blob/main/_pages/cv.md).
