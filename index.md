My name is Yunxi Wang, and I am a Mechanical Engineering Student at Cornell University. I am interested in robotics and it's applications in aerospace. I am a student developer at the Cornell Mechatronics Learning Studio, where I create instructional labs for students on subjects such as motor-selection and encoders.
